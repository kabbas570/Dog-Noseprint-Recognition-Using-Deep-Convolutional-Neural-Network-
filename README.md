### Dog-Noseprint-Recognition-and-Localization-
Dogs' nose have unique patterns as a human's fingerprints.It  can be used to accurately identify the dogs species. 
The Canadian Kennel Club has been accepting dog nose prints as proof of identity since 1938.
This project exploredthe idea of "Dog Noseprint Recognition and Localization", using a hybrid CNN network for both clasification and localization.
## The network has three parts:
1- CNN extracts the features from Input Image
2- Regression part estimates the position of dogâ€™s nose
3- Classification part predicts the dog class
